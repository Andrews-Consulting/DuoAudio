DuoAudio Application v1.0
====================================

This app was (for the most part) entirely generated by AI.  It was completed in about 5 hours.  There are a few bugs in the diagnostic section, 
but it works well enough to put out here.  

We use this on a daily basis to listen to windows audio on multiple devices simultaneously in multiple rooms in the house.  
Currently, we are using Edifier R1280DBs speakers in bluetooth mode.
I haven't really tested out the some of the bluetooth recovery function yet, but I'll get to that shortly.


QUICK START (once built)
------------
1. Run DuoAudio.exe
2. Select a Source Device (audio output to capture from)
3. Select a Destination Device (where to play the audio)
4. Check "Enable Duplication"
5. Click "Start Duplication"

WHAT THIS APPLICATION DOES
---------------------------
This application captures audio from an output device (like your speakers) 
and duplicates it to another output device (like Bluetooth headphones) in 
real-time using WASAPI loopback capture.

EXAMPLE USE CASES
-----------------
- Play music through speakers AND Bluetooth headphones simultaneously
- Route audio to multiple rooms with different speaker systems
- Share audio with someone using separate headphones

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- At least 2 audio output devices
- .NET 9.0 Runtime (included in this self-contained build)

END USER FILES
-----
- DuoAudio.exe - The application (single file, self-contained)
- README.txt - This file

DOCUMENTATION

- USER_GUIDE.md - Complete user guide with tutorials and FAQ
- README.md - Technical documentation
- TEST_RESULTS.md - Test results and validation

DEVELOPERS
----------
This was built and developed in VS Code. 
You can build the application using the following command:  (assumes .NET 9.0 SDK is installed)
    Dotnet Build -c [Debug | Release]
Publish it with: (this command assumes working directory is DuoAudio)
    dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o "../publish"
Build the installer file with: (assumes Inno Setup is installed)
    Build-Installer.bat

AI placed the build files in interesting locations.  I'll move them to a more logical place in the future.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If no devices appear, ensure audio devices are connected and enabled
- If audio doesn't play, check device volumes and ensure devices aren't in use
- For Bluetooth issues, try manually reconnecting the device in Windows settings
